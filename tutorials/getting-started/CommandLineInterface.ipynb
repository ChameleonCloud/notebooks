    "\n",
    "We're actually going to reserve two things on Chameleon: a bare metal node, and a public IP address. While Chameleon has several nodes and IP addresses for use by researchers, the supply is still constrained relative to the amount of people using the system, so, unlike commercial clouds like AWS, it is important to reserve them ahead of time. In practice there are usually enough commodity hardware that you can use for exploration right away.\n",

    "\n",
    "  - `--physical-reservation`: used whenever you are reserving a bare metal node. This takes a list of properties to apply to the reservation: a `min` and `max` number of nodes (these can be the same), and a `resource_properties` selector that defines how to pick the nodes from the inventory.\n",
    "  - `--reservation`: used for reserving things other than bare metal nodes. This also takes a list of properties: `resource_type` denotes the type of thing being reserved, e.g. \"virtual:floatingip\" for a public IP address, and then a list of required properties for that type, e.g. `network_id` and `amount` are required for the \"virtual:floatingip\" type, the former denoting which Network to allocate the IP from, the latter indicating how many IPs.\n",
    "  - `--start-date`: finally an easy one! Denotes when the lease should start (YYYY-mm-dd HH:MM format)\n",
    "  - `--end-date`: when the lease should end. If not defined, defaults to one day from the start date.\n",
    "  \n",
    "It is possible to specify only `--physical-reservation` if only a bare metal node is desired, and similarly, only `--reservation` if only some other type of reservation is desired. The following example utilizes both, because we want to reserve an IP address and a node."

    "In this tutorial, you learned how to create a lease for resources on the Chameleon testbed using the `blazar` CLI in Bash.

You also got a (brief) introduction to the `openstack` CLI, which can be used to inspect and control most of the testbed. Chameleon runs on top of OpenStack, so most public documentation on OpenStack also applies to Chameleon. Finally, you learned how to assign a public IP to your launched instance, and (hopefully!) were able to log in to the node via SSH and your private SSH keypair stored in your Jupyter Notebook server.\n",
