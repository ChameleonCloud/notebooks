    "# Using Heat Templates to Configure Chameleon Instances\n",
    "In previous tutorials we have gone over how to create and configure instances and [networks](https://jupyter.chameleoncloud.org/import?source=github&src_path=chameleoncloud/notebooks&file_path=examples%2Fconfiguration%2FUsingSSHToConfigureNameResolution.ipynb#Create-Reservations) in a progressively more automated fashion, from using the web interface, to embed instructions in Jupyter Notebooks, and finally using Jupyter Notebook + Ansible. \n",
    "\n",
    "This time, we will raise the bar once again and use a heat template to create an entire experiment -- reservation, servers, network, experiment -- without human intervention besides starting the build process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook you will learn\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What a heat template is\n",
    "1. How to write and run one. As before we will create and run an experiment using multiple servers inside a custom network. Yes, it is the same experiment we ran before using iperf.\n",
    "1. How to set up a reservation in the future that will automatically create your experiment from scratch at the reserved time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "* This tutorial is but an overview of heat templates.\n",
    "* We will be using the web interface for most of the presentation as it helps us see the steps. However, running Heat Templates is most efficent if running through command line.\n",

    "### Prerequisites\n",

    "## The heat template\n",
    "Heat is a service to build (or orchestrate) and run experiments and applications using yaml-based Heat Orchestration Templates (HOT). The format is very similar to the [AWS CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html) one\n",
    "### A Simple Template\n",
    "We will explain how the template works by looking at a simple example. We need to define at least\n",
    "- Parameters\n",
    "- Resources\n",
    "#### Parameters:\n",
    "That is where we define variables that can be supplied by the user. Some have a default value (in this case the default image is `CC-CentOS7` and the default network is `sharednet1`)\n",
    "```yaml\n",

    "The available heat template versions are listed in https://chi.uc.chameleoncloud.org/project/template_versions/\n",
    "#### Resources\n",

    "  1. Connect the server to the floating IP. Note that this resource needs the server and its floating IP already defined, so it will wait for them to be created.\n",

    "  1. Create server (ext-server) we will connect to collect the results. There is a script here that is not necessary but shows another example of resource precedence: in hommage to a Chameleon [blog](https://jupyter.chameleoncloud.org/import?source=github&src_path=chameleoncloud/notebooks&file_path=examples%2Fconfiguration%2FUsingSSHToConfigureNameResolution.ipynb), we populate the `/etc/hosts` by obtaining the IP addresses for both the iperf server and client (which is done by the statements inside `params:` below).

Remember we need **3** servers.\n",

    "1. Monitoring the progress. If you go to the instances, you will noticed for quite a while the only server listed is `iperf-server`. As `iperf-client` and `ext-server` need information from `iperf-server` (well, `ext-server` needs info from both), `iperf-client` will only be created after `iperf-server` is up and running. And then it will be `ext-server`'s turn; by then the experiment will be concluded since it is a rather fast one. However, we should account for that when we reserve our lease; that will be time we will not have for the experiment.\n",
