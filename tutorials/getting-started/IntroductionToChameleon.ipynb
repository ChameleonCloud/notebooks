    "This tutorial will teach you the basics of using a cloud computing environment as a platform for Computer Science research. Besides introducing you to the Chameleon testbed, you will learn some basic cloud computing concepts, which you can apply to any cloud provider, such as [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/), [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/), and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background: Cloud Computing for Experimentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the cloud for running experimentation, simulation, and other scientific tasks requires thinking about things a bit differently. While ultimately the hardware that is running your code may physically reside in a data center similar to one you may already be using in a national laboratory or academic instutition, the _interface_ to the compute resources tends to be quite different. For one, cloud environments allow for **high configurability**, often allowing you to create arbitrary network topologies, provision machines with varied locality (e.g. the same physical rack, or entirely different continents), and access a wide variety of heterogenous hardware, all via a unified remote management interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clouds are typically multi-tenant; multiple users are utilizing a pool of resources and sharing them, even if they often might not realize or think about this. In order to partition a cloud's resources, whether it's networking, compute cores, or storage/memory, several abstraction patterns have emerged that tend to be the same across any cloud provider. You could consider them to be a cloud's _interface_: a cloud necessarily should provide these resources to be a cloud. Some of the most important (and common) patterns are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bootable disk images**: disk images with an OS, usually preconfigured with some \"main\" software stack or otherwise tuned for a specific purpose, like a MySQL database, or a Hadoop node.\n",
    "  - AWS equivalent: [AMI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html)\n",
    "  - Chameleon equivalent: [Image](https://chameleoncloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/technical/images.html)\n",
    "- **Orchestration templates**: a combination of disk images, with rules for how to deploy those disk images in a certain configuration, usually involving other aspects of the cloud, such as networking or storage.\n",
    "  - AWS equivalent: [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/).\n",
    "  - Chameleon equivalent: [Complex Appliance (Heat)](https://chameleoncloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/technical/complex.html)\n",
    "- **Virtualized networking**: a conceptual model of a network is usually expressed with three primary domain entities:\n",
    "  1. _Network_: the top-level resource. This can be a layer-2 concept and include a VLAN tag, or just be a \"holder\" for the other domain entities.\n",
    "    - AWS equivalent: [VPC](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\n",

    "    - Chameleon equilvanet: [Router](https://chameleoncloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/technical/networks/networks_vlan.html#creating-a-router)\n",
    "- **Object storage**: a shared and highly-available storage backend used for storing blobs of data. This is different than a block storage device in that it represents files as opaque entities; they are not a series of blocks that you can access. Usually object storage is used for storing various cloud entities, such as disk images or orchestration templates, but any arbitrary data can be stored here as well, such as experiment results or input data sets.\n",

    "- **Key pairs**: public-key cryptography is used to allow access to compute resources; users therefore are given a way to manage which public keys can be used to authenticate them when they log on. (This is a separate authentication mechanism to the user's cloud username/password, which is used to log in to the cloud provider itself.)\n",

    "### What is Chameleon?\n",
    "\n",
    "Chameleon is a highly configurable environment for large-scale cloud research. Not only is Chameleon suitable for research in to how clouds can be improved and built, Chameleon is also implemented as a cloud itself! Therefore, it adheres to the _interface_ defined in the previous section, as you can see.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chameleon is unique in that it offers a limited amount of highly-specialized heterogenous hardware, and also a (less-limited) cluster of commodity machines. Due to the specialized nature of the machines available in the cloud, sometimes the demand exceeds the supply. In order to provide fairness to the users of Chameleon, users must therefore make an _advanced reservation_ for the resources required. This is a notable difference from commercial cloud providers such as AWS, which have a much larger inventory of relatively homoegenous hardware. Please keep this in mind as you use Chameleon, and when you no longer require the resources you've reserved, release them back in to the pool by ending your reservation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another unique aspect of Chameleon is that it provisions exclusively on _bare metal_. This means there is no multi-tenancy on the hardware you reserve; it is for your exclusive use. All of the Chameleon hardware is provisioned in this fashion. Though some cloud providers support limited bare metal use cases (e.g. AWS [bare metal instance types](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/05/announcing-general-availability-of-amazon-ec2-bare-metal-instances/)), most only support virtualized environments, e.g. VMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The experimental workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is structured around a framework we refer to as the **Experimental Workflow**. A typical experiment consists of several phases. First, you **design the experiment**; you have some idea of what you would like to test. Next, you figure out what **resources** exist to help you instantiate your experiment. In a cloud environment, this step is important to call out, because likely the cloud has many different types of resources available to you, and it is your task to figure out which are the most relevant to your needs. Once you have found suitable resources, you **provision** them--this means, you set up or otherwise \"activate\" them for your experiment. Then, the main part of your experiment setup begins, where you **configure** the resources as needed to run your experiment. This is typically an **interactive** step, at least initially: you are discovering how to run your experiment optimally. This is also the step where you get your hands dirty and start running tests! Once your experiment is running, you **monitor** the state of the experiment and results generated. Finally, armed with your experimental data, you **analyze**, **discuss** the results, and hopefully **share** them with the wider community. This often leads to you refining your experiment, or having new ideas for new experiments, and the cycle begins again.\n",

We'll go over **discovering resources** via the Chameleon Hardware Catalog, **provisioning resources** by reserving bare metal nodes and launching server instances on them, **configuring and interacting** with our instances via SSH, and finally **monitoring** the state of our experiment via metrics exported automatically from our server instances. Let's get started!\n",

    "### The Chameleon hardware catalog\n",
    "\n",
    "Chameleon has a [browseable catalog of hardware available for reservation](https://www.chameleoncloud.org/hardware/). You can filter the list of resources available across many dimensions. The big buttons near the top allow easily filtering by a specific \"node type\". Most nodes of the same type have the same properties, but there are sometimes nodes within a type that have extra capabilities, such as an additional network card active. There are additional common filters displayed immediately below that allow you to e.g. filter by nodes only at a specific regional site. You can expand the advanced filters below to see even more options. If a filter does not apply (because all filtered nodes have the same value for this option), it will be disabled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have narrowed your search down a bit, you can click the \"View\" button below to see the list of nodes, with all of their details, that matched your query.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be helpful if you want to know specifics about the types of hardware available for experimentation. In particular, you can see what types of CPU processors are on the node, as well as how many disk drives it has, how much memory, and any other particularities about the node that could make it an interesting candidate for your experiment.\n",

    "### Types of bare metal nodes available on Chameleon\n",
    "\n",
    "A few practical notes about the [node types](https://chameleoncloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/technical/reservations.html#chameleon-node-types):\n",
    "\n",
    "- `compute_skylake`: Besides having an Intel Skylake processor, these nodes are great options for those who are looking to perform SDN experiments, because their primary network interface is connected to a Corsa DP2000 switch, which gives you a virtual router that can have its control plane be controlled by you.\n",
    "- `compute_haswell`: These are the workhorse nodes on Chameleon, and have Intel Haswell processors. They are the most plentiful, so are good candidates for large cluster experiments. They also have two NICs available instead of one, so there are some possibilities for more advanced networking topologies here.\n",
    "- `storage`, `storage_hierarchy`: As expected, these nodes have a _lot_ of storage space. The `storage_hierarchy` nodes have the storage split between memory, NVMes, SSDs, and HDDs, allowing for interesting experiments around caching strategies.\n",
    "- `compute_haswell_ib`: These are special Haswell nodes that are also connected via InfiniBand.\n",
    "- `gpu_*`: These nodes all have at least one NVIDIA GPU on board.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using the hardware API\n",
    "\n",
    "If you like, you can interact with the hardware catalog over an HTTP/JSON API as well!

    "1. This panel displays all leases currently pending or active (or already terminated) for your project. Click \"Create Lease\" to open the lease creation modal.\n",
    "1. The only field required in this modal is the lease name, but you likely want to fill in other details. You can specify the time range (note that you are limited to 7 days maximum; for more information on lease restrictions visit our [FAQ](https://www.chameleoncloud.org/about/frequently-asked-questions/#toc-are-there-any-limitations-of-chameleon-usage-)), the start date (to queue up a lease in the future), whether to reserve bare metal machines, network resources, or both, and fine-tune the bare metal node selection with filters.\n",

You must also specify which reservation to launch the instance under; this determines which set of nodes will be used when picking one to host the instance. The lease name will display in this drop-down to help you pick.\n",
    "1. Click the \"Source\" tab on the left to choose the image you wish to launch. If this is your first time, we recommend using the CC-CentOS7 image. You can filter the list of images with the filter box. **Note**: it may take a while to display the list of images. You may need to wait a few seconds for the entire list to show up.\n",
    "1. Click the \"Flavor\" tab and click the up-arrow icon to select the \"baremetal\" flavor, which is the only option.\n",
    "1. Click the \"Networks\" tab and similarly, select a network to attach to the node. **Note**: you can only attach as many networks as you have NICs enabled on the node. For most nodes, there is only 1 NIC enabled, so only 1 network can be selected.\n",
    "1. Click the \"Key Pair\" tab and select which SSH keys with which you wish to allow authenticating to the instance over SSH. **This is important to do, otherwise you will not be able to access your instance!**\n",
    "1. Click \"Launch Instance\" to trigger the build of your instance with these parameters. You should see your image in the \"Build\" state, and it should transition through a few stages, such as \"Scheduling\", \"Networking\", and \"Spawning\", before arriving in the \"Active\" state.
