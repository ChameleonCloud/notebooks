    "# Background: \n",
    "\n",
    "Chameleon is composed of two OpenStack sites with deeply programmable compute, storage, and networking infrastructure. This tutorial focuses on advanced networking features including Bring-your-own-controller (BYOC) software defined networking (SDN). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Chameleon Networking\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the two Chameleon sites is includes 100 Gbps uplink connectivity to shared core network that can be used to connect Chameleon nodes to core services, other Chameleon nodes, and even external facilities including GENI.  By default, each Chameleon node can access the public Internet through the core network. Advanced experiments can allocate tenant controlled SDN networks and isolated layer2 circuits across the core to connect Chameleon nodes and external facilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Software Defined Networking on Chameleon\n",
    "\n",
    "Chameleon’s Bring Your Own Controller (BYOC) functionality enables tenants to create isolated network switches managed using OpenFlow controllers provided by the user. This feature is targeted at users wishing to experiment with software-defined networking (SDN) as well as users with experiments that have non-standard networking requirements. \n",
    "\n",
    "OpenFlow switches, like traditional switches, forward network traffic between a number of ports used to connect other networks and devices. The primary difference is that OpenFlow switches rely on external software (a “controller”) to dynamically manage the rules (or “flows”) that determine how and where the traffic is forwarded. In addition, OpenFlow enables a much larger set of possible rules which can be imposed on the traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic requirements of an OpenFlow network are the switch and the controller. The switch is configured with the IP address and port of a controller (software) that manages the switch’s rules. When a packet arrives at the switch, the packet is tested against the rules that are known by the switch to determine what action(s) to take. Typically, if there are no rules that apply to a packet, the packet is sent to the controller which replies with a set of rules for that type of packet. The new rules are cached in the switch and applied to subsequent packets until the rules expire or are explicitly removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chameleon provides BYOC networking in order to enable tenants to allocate OpenFlow switches controlled by their own OpenFlow controller(s). This capability is limited to the phase 2 hardware additions that include the Corsa DP2000 series OpenFlow switches and Skylake compute nodes. The Corsa switches are key to enabling the BYOC functionality. These switches provide a native abstraction for the creation of mutually isolated forwarding contexts which can be thought of as independent OpenFlow switches. Each isolated forwarding context can be configured to use its own OpenFlow controller. The Chameleon BYOC functionality enables tenants to specify the IP and port of an arbitrary OpenFlow controller when they create private networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tutorial:\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter tutorial will help you setup the following experimental infrastructure. The experiment includes an OpenFlow controller hosted on Chameleon, an OpenFlow swtich, and two nodes connected to the switch.\n",
