The more advance method presented in this tutorial shows how separate management of the stitched links the compute nodes.  Separate management allows for multiple stitched links to be dynamically added and removed after the experiment has been instantiated. The flexibility  provided by this method makes it the recommended method for all DirectStitch experiments. \n"
